The :mod:`sourcemod` module is far from complete. It needs many things, including menus and sdktools interaction. However, everything must start from somewhere. I will tell you that I have every intention of completing Viper, even if it doesn't seem like it at times.

I've tried to keep the naming of the modules similar to SourceMod's. But I'm in an advantageous position compared to SourceMod, because I'm not forced to maintain backwards compatibility, yet, so I can correct any anomalies in naming SourceMod was forced to add. If a function seemed like it fit better in another module, I put it there. So while SourceMod's naming was a guide, Viper is not organized the same way.

At this early stage (after almost 4 years of working), I'd really appreciate any suggestions or bug reports at the `Viper Bugzilla <http://bugs.alliedmods.net/enter_bug.cgi?product=Viper>`_ graciously provided by `AlliedModders <http://alliedmods.net/>`_.
