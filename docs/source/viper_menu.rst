The Viper Menu
==============

Administration with Viper is very similar to administration with SourceMod.

The Viper menu can be accessed through the command `sm py`. Running `sm py` will give you a print out of all the available options.

Like SourceMod, to load a plug-in use `sm py plugins load <plugin>`. To unload a plug-in, use `sm py plugins unload <plugin>`. To reload a plug-in, use `sm py plugins reload <plugin>`.
